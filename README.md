# PongByLeo

My implementation of Pong using C++. That's the chapter 1 of [Game Programming in C++](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35187592-game-programming-in-c), by [Sanjay Madhav](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Madhav/Sanjay). 

Made using Visual Studio 2019 Community, with C++ support for games, and [SDL Library](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL).
